Mobile devices are becoming indispensible in todayâ€™s world and present an opportunity to extract a wealth of information that could be used in many constructive ways. For example, mobile device movement aggregated across large number of users in a geographical area could be used to deduce traffic movement trends in that location. Yet another example would be to determine population density in a given locality.

This project aims to explore mobile device movement as a means to gather such statistics and present trends, which can then further be, used in various use cases like city planning, traffic trend predictor. The intent is to acquire this information from cellular companies in the form of data feeds, use Hadoop as data storage considering the volume and map-reduce jobs to get analyze and offer trends. This data is then fed into mapping tools to visualize this information.
